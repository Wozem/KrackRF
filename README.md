## Description
Hello, this is my very first actual RF project, so dont expect it to have no bugs.
I am trying to make a RF transmitter (or a transceiver later), it should have a ~85mhz to ~4Ghz
TX frequency range. Doing the PCB and schematics are the easy part, but writing firmware is the
hard one, i think i may use AI.
Any collaboration or help is appreciated.
